# first-prototype
This processing prototype makes it possible to read the statements posted though Moodies (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bvc.moodies&hl=en) and posted on my Twitter account ( @Luisa_12345).
The statements are then represented as circles with different behaviours.
